### how do i use this?

`> bdl download <url>` should work.

You'll need an environment variable of `SAVE_PATH` if you want to change the default save path, which is the current directory.

(you can use a .env file for this, it just needs to be in your current directory)

### what sites are supported?

currently, these sites are supported:
* danbooru.donmai.us
* gelbooru.com

if you know how to, feel free to add more stuff or update whatever is currently here!

### what do i need to do to help?
not 100% sure currently, but here are some guidelines to follow:
* comment your code thoroughly
* make sure your code passes a basic clippy lint
* explain what you changed when you make a pull request

### TODO
* add more sites
* actual error handling
